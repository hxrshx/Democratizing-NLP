# Democratizing-NLP

* Provide an interface where a User can upload the Dataset and perform various Natural Language based tasks on the Dataset
* -The User can select the Pre-Processing Methodologies to be advocated, and can download the Pre-Processed Dataset for further computation
* -The User can perform Machine Learning Algorithms on the Dataset, and can determine the accuracy of the established model
* -A total of 5 ML Algorithms have been taken - KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest and Naive Bayes, which are all Classification Algorithms
* -Any model, which the User decides, can be downloaded as a pickle file, and can be used for further computation
* -A feature named “NER as a Text Box” has also been included with the Project
